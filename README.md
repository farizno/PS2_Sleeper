This project contains the files that I used to make a fully functioning "Sleeper" Playstation 2 with a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) inside. The main goal of the project is to have a fully functioning device that serves multiple functions. The Raspberry Pi desktop and operating system should be fully functional, but additionally will run Emulationstation as well to have a fully functional retro gaming system.

Another requirement fo the project is to also keep as much of the original PS2 components intact so that there is not much difference from the outside. For that reason, the priginal front-pannel USB ports will be utilized as well as (in the future) the controller ports will also be integrated so that original PS2 controllers can be used.

A custom PCB was made on prototype board to integrate the existing power button and LEDs as well as the eject button and the LED on it. The files contained herein are the scripts required to make it function
